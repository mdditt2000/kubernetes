In particular you need to ensure you add the "--insecure" flag otherwise you will see errors like:

```
2019/04/12 17:13:44 [DEBUG] [as3_log] Processing AS3 POST call with AS3 Manager
2019/04/12 17:13:44 [DEBUG] [as3_log] REST call with AS3 Manager
2019/04/12 17:13:44 [ERROR] [as3_log] REST call error: Post https://10.1.20.10/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare: x509: cannot validate certificate for 10.1.20.10 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
```
 
Continue to not validate the SSL certificate for non-AS3 related REST API calls. There is work to improve this workflow in the future (currently it will only work with a CA signed certificate if you do not specify the --insecure flag).
